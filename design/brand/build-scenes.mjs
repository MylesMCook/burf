//
//   - every <svg data-scene> on the board is re-rendered from
//     app/src/components/art/scenes.tsx (the real <Scene> component), keeping
//     its width, its still flag and any x/y it is placed at;
//   - the "Scenes" gallery gets one card per name in SCENES;
//   - the "Where each scene appears" map is read from app/src: every
//     <Scene name=…> (including names chosen in an expression, such as
//     name={filtered ? "lighthouse" : "ended"}), with its file and line;
//   - the scene styles are copied from app/src/components/art/scenes.css.
//
//   node design/brand/build-scenes.mjs           rewrite index.html
//   node design/brand/build-scenes.mjs --check   exit 1 if it is out of date
//
// It needs app/node_modules (pnpm -C app install). A placement or a scene
// with no words below fails the build: describe it in PLACES or SCENE_COPY.
