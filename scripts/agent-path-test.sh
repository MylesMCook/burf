# Agent CLIs installed with npm, in Docker: a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 box with
# berthd as its systemd user service (installed first, so its PATH knows
# nothing of what comes after), then Claude Code installed the way many
# people do, with nvm and `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`. nvm lives in
# ~/.bashrc, which neither berthd's service PATH nor a login shell reads.
# berthd must find it all the same, through the person's interactive shell:
# doctor names it with its path, the box offers it, and a session started
# with it runs it, with node found beside it. Nothing signs in to Claude:
# the session only runs `claude --version`, and the agent's own session is
# stopped at its first screen. Downloads nvm, Node and the npm package, so
# it needs the network as well as Docker and Go.
