// Settings → Developer can bring it back for this window.
//
// It must never show over boxes that exist. Two things used to make it:
//  - "Show onboarding again" was remembered in localStorage, so a forced
//    onboarding outlived the session it was asked for and came back on
//    every launch, boxes or not. It now lasts for this window only
//    (sessionStorage), and the old key is cleared.
//  - Merely showing the welcome step marked onboarding "in progress", so a
//    status that briefly listed no boxes at start-up (the agent still
//    reading them) kept the gate up after the boxes arrived. Now only
//    leaving the welcome step while there are truly no boxes starts it, and
//    the gate drops at once if boxes turn up before then.
