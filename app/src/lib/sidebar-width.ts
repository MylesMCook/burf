// room for the actions that fade in over a row's end without covering all
// of it. 240px is the width it always had. 420px fits a long display name
// with its worktree's own name beside it (about 50 characters); wider only
// adds empty space and takes it from the terminals. The widest is also held
// to 40% of the window, so a small window keeps its room for work.
