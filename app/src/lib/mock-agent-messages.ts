const LEDGER_REPORT = `# Ledger writes in acme/billing

I didn't change any files. Every write to \`ledger_entries\` goes through three paths, and two of them have no idempotency key, so a retried refund can write the same row twice.

## Where the writes are

| Path | File | Keyed | Writes a day |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoice settle | \`services/billing/settle.go:88\` | yes | ~41k |
| Refund | \`services/billing/refund.go:132\` | **no** | ~2.3k |
| Retry worker | \`services/billing/retry/worker.go:57\` | **no** | ~900 |

## Recent commits that touch them

- \`4e1a9c2\` billing: settle invoices in one transaction (Mara Lind, 3 days ago)
- \`b07d3f1\` refund: write the ledger row before the provider call (Theo Okafor, last week)
- \`91c55ae\` retry: re-enqueue on 5xx without a key (Theo Okafor, 2 weeks ago)

## What I'd do

1. Add \`idempotency_key\` to \`ledger_entries\`, nullable at first, and backfill it from the key \`settle.go\` already has.
2. Thread a key through \`refund.go\` and the retry worker. \`91c55ae\` is where the double writes came from.
3. Make the column \`NOT NULL\` once both paths write it.

Read these first: \`services/billing/ledger/write.go\`, \`services/billing/retry/worker.go\` and \`db/migrations/0142_ledger_v2.sql\`.`;

// The busy scene's ledger report is longer than a screen: every call site.
const LEDGER_FULL = `${LEDGER_REPORT}

## Every call site

| # | Caller | Line | Path |
|---|---|---|---|
${Array.from({ length: 34 }, (_, i) => `| ${i + 1} | \`services/billing/${["settle", "refund", "retry/worker", "invoice", "credit"][i % 5]}.go\` | ${40 + i * 7} | ${["settle", "refund", "retry", "settle", "refund"][i % 5]} |`).join("\n")}`;

const EXPORT_REPORT = `## Export reads of the ledger

The nightly export (\`services/export/ledger_csv.go\`) still reads \`ledger_v1\` in two places:

- \`ledger_csv.go:41\` selects from \`ledger_v1\` for invoices older than 90 days
- \`ledger_csv.go:77\` joins \`ledger_v1\` for refunds

Both can move to \`ledger_entries\` once the backfill is done; the column names match except \`amount_cents\` → \`amount\`.`;
