// Each release's highlights, newest first, for the What's new card
// (components/whats-new). Not the changelog (docs/changelog.mdx): four to
// six things a person would want to try, in a sentence or two each, and
// one line each for a few smaller ones. A release with nothing worth a card
// gets no entry, and the card doesn't show.
//
// `version` is the version the release ships as (make publish VERSION=…):
// the card shows once to anyone who updates to it or past it.
