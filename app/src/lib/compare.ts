// first worktree's tabs, in its group), whose two panes belong to one
// worktree each (leaf.wt, as in a tab that mixes worktrees), so the
// breadcrumb, Run, ⌘T and the palette follow whichever side has the focus.
//
// A lane is what both sides show: their agents' chats, their diffs, their
// dev servers' pages, their agents' terminals, or their artifacts' boards. Chat and Terminal are one
// pane per side (the agent's), always shown as its terminal.
// The panes of a lane not showing are parked, still mounted, so coming back
// to it reloads nothing. These are the pure parts; lib/compare-actions.ts
// applies them to the store. No imports but layout: pnpm test runs this.
