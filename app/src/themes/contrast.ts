// What a theme must meet to ship with Burf (contrast.test.ts runs it over
// every built-in theme; a theme of your own is not held to it):
//
// - Text is AA, 4.5:1: body text on every surface it sits on, muted text
//   on the page, the sidebar, cards, menus and a highlighted row (a menu's
//   item under the keyboard, a hovered row), the sidebar's text on its
//   selected row, a button's label on the button, links, and the
//   terminal's text on its background.
// - The focus ring is 3:1 on every surface it is drawn on (WCAG's bar for
//   UI that isn't text), so the keyboard's place is always seen.
// - A state's text colour (success, warning, destructive, info) is 4.5:1
//   on its own tint, the 16% wash badges and banners put behind it.
// - A state's own colour, a dot or a spinner, is 3:1 on the page and the
//   sidebar (WCAG's bar for UI that isn't text).
// - Done, waiting, failed and running look different from each other, and
//   the first three from the theme's primary colour.
