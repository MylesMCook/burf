# Usage & accounts

A built-in plugin, **off by default**. Turn it on in Settings → Plugins. It adds a **Usage** screen to the sidebar and two commands, "Show agent usage" and "Switch agent account".

## Usage

The screen shows how many tokens Claude Code and Codex used on your boxes. Pick today, 7 days or 30 days, and see the tokens:

- by agent;
- by model;
- by project or worktree;
- by session.

Each session has **Open** if it is still running in Shipyard, or **Resume** (`claude --resume <id>`, `codex resume <id>`) in its worktree.

**All boxes** is the default; the box picker remembers your last choice.

- Every online box is read at once, and each shows its own state: transcripts read, still reading, or the error. A slow or failing box doesn't hold up the rest. Offline boxes are listed as "not counted (offline)".
- Agent cards add the boxes up and show each box's share. The daily chart stacks by agent or by box. The model and project tables have a Box column, and sessions from every box are merged newest first, each with its box.
- A login used on several boxes counts once: plans and Codex limits are matched by the email the agent recorded, keeping the newest limits.
- Each box keeps its own days, in its own time zone.

The numbers come from the files each agent writes on the box. Nothing is estimated or made up.

| Agent | Read from | What's in it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` and each account's `<dir>/projects` | `message.usage` on each assistant message, deduplicated by message and request id. It also holds Claude Code's own per-session `totalCostUSD`. |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` and each account's `<dir>/sessions` | `token_count` events (cumulative totals per session) and the `rate_limits` Codex last saw. |

- **Input** excludes cached input. Cache reads and writes are shown separately; Codex's `input_tokens` includes its cached tokens, so the plugin subtracts them.
- **Cost** is shown only for Claude Code, and only as Claude Code's own estimate at API list prices. On a subscription (Claude Max or Pro) the screen says the plan covers the use. Codex gets no dollar figure: it records none, and the plugin keeps no price table.
- **Plan limits** are shown only for Codex, which writes its 5-hour and weekly windows into its transcripts. They show as "as of" the last turn Codex took. A window that has reset since says so instead of showing an old percentage. Claude Code doesn't write its limits anywhere the plugin can read, so it shows none.

### How it runs on the box

[`box/usage.py`](box/usage.py) runs through `exec` with `python3`; the box needs nothing installed.

- It reads files newest first.
- It stops after 45 seconds (`BERTH_USAGE_BUDGET`) and reports what is still pending. The screen asks again until it's done.
- It caches each file's summary by size and mtime in `~/.cache/berth-usage/files.json`.
- Its answer stays under exec's 64 KB output cap.

## Accounts

A box can have several logins per agent. Each login lives in its own folder:

| Agent | Default | More accounts | Picked with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude` (profile in `~/.claude.json`) | `~/.berth/accounts/claude/<name>` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Codex | `~/.codex` | `~/.berth/accounts/codex/<name>` | `CODEX_HOME` |

**Add account…** creates the folder (mode 0700) and opens a terminal in the current worktree. It runs the agent's own sign-in with that folder:

- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<dir> claude`;
- `CODEX_HOME=<dir> codex login --device-auth`.

You finish signing in yourself; the plugin never reads or stores credentials. It shows only the email, plan and sign-in method the agent recorded.

**Use for new sessions** sets the variable in one of two places:

- **Everywhere on a box:** in the box's `~/.berth/env.json` (`GET`/`PUT /v1/env`). Every worktree gets it, under the project's own env.
- **One project:** in that project's box-local config (`PUT /v1/locations/{name}/config`, `local.env`). It wins over the box.

Choosing the default account removes the variable. Running sessions keep the account they started with. The screen shows which account each running session uses, read from its tmux environment.

**Add account…** also installs Shipyard's hooks and skills in the new folder, when the box has them for that agent: without them, the box could only guess from the screen when a session on that account is working, done or needs you. berthd installs them in every account folder it knows (the default, every folder under `~/.berth/accounts`, and the folders `env.json` and the projects pick), and in the folder a new session's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `CODEX_HOME` names, before its agent starts. Codex reads skills from `~/.agents/skills` on every account. `berthd integrations` lists them per account; see [Agent integrations](../../docs/guides/agent-integrations.mdx#every-account).

`CODEX_HOME` is Codex's documented home folder. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is the variable Claude Code reads for its config folder. On a Linux box each folder keeps its own login. On a Mac box, Claude Code keeps its credentials in the keychain; check that a second account really signs in on its own before relying on it.

## Developing

`pnpm -C app build:plugins` bundles it into `app/public/builtin-plugins/usage/`, with `usage.py` inlined as text. In `?mock=1`, `app/src/lib/mock-usage.ts` answers the script and `/v1/env` with made-up numbers. There are screenshots in `design/plugins/usage-*.png`.
