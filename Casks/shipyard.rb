# Burf for macOS, as a Homebrew cask. This repository is its own tap:
#
#   brew tap MylesMCook/burf https://github.com/MylesMCook/burf
#   brew install --cask MylesMCook/burf/burf
#
# The dmg's name carries no version and the app updates itself (Restart to
# update), so the cask follows releases/latest and has nothing to bump at
# release time. The app is signed and notarized; Gatekeeper checks it on
# first open, in place of a checksum here.
