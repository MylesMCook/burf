# Shipyard for macOS, as a Homebrew cask. This repository is its own tap:
#
#   brew tap cosscom/shipyard https://github.com/cosscom/shipyard
#   brew install --cask cosscom/shipyard/shipyard
#
# The dmg's name carries no version and the app updates itself (Restart to
# update), so the cask follows releases/latest and has nothing to bump at
# release time. The app is signed and notarized; Gatekeeper checks it on
# first open, in place of a checksum here.
