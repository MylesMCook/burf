# Third-party themes

Shipyard's built-in themes include ports of these VS Code themes. Each was
mapped onto Shipyard's colour tokens from the theme's own palette (its VS Code
colours and terminal ANSI 16, as published in its repository and copied
into [`@shikijs/themes`](https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes)).
Where a colour fell short of the contrast Shipyard keeps (body and muted text
at 4.5:1, see `app/src/themes/contrast.ts`), it was moved in lightness only;
`app/src/themes/vscode.ts` notes each such change. Code in diffs and chat
replies is coloured by the theme's own Shiki theme.

done, waiting and running apart).
